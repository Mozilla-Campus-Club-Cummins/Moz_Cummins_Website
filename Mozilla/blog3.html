                  Google Summer of Code program is a program started by Google and has completed 17 years. It is a program that aims to promote open-source software development among university students. There are a few organizations and these organizations have mentors. First, the organizations apply to Google and after the organizations are selected then the students apply to the organizations. Bear in mind that you are not an employee of Google or even not an intern at Google. You’re working with that organization that you applied to or got selected in. It is a paid program with a stipend of 1500 USD for Medium Size Projects and 3000 USD for Large Size Projects in India.Here’s the application <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/" target="_blank"> link </a>

                  One thing that an open-source project cannot get enough of is good documentation. However, Google Season of Docs is a new program by Google where technical writers and open source organizations come together and work on open source projects. The technical writers write documentation for open source organizations and also get paid by Google. It is a worthwhile platform for students to learn from industry experts and to work on open-source projects. Also, you need to remember that you must be aged 18 or more at the time of registration to become eligible for Google Season of Docs.Here’s the application <a href="https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs/" target="_blank"> link </a>
